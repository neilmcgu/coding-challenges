/*
Crypto Sandbox / Three Js implementation

we want to combine the two projects into one.
we will first have to eestablish a connection from sound safari to my browser or something else
another way i could see of doing it is to download the data ahead of time outside of the program.
we can start with a .json file or something and go from there
