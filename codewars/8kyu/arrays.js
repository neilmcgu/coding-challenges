// find multiples of a number

// In this simple exercise, you will build a program that takes a value, integer , and returns a list of its multiples up to another value, limit . If limit is a multiple of integer, it should be included as well. There will only ever be positive integers passed into the function, not consisting of 0. The limit will always be higher than the base.

// For example, if the parameters passed are (2, 6), the function should return [2, 4, 6] as 2, 4, and 6 are the multiples of 2 up to 6.


// my solution:
function findMultiples(integer, limit) {
    //your code here
    let arr = []
    for(let i = integer; i<=limit; i++){
      if(i % integer == 0){
        arr.push(i)
      }
    }
    return arr
  }
//refactored
function findMultiples(integer, limi){

}  

// other solutions:
function findMultiples(int,limit){
    let result = []
    
    for (let i = int; i<=limit ; i+=int)
      result.push(i)
      
    return result
}

// Counting sheep...

// Consider an array/list of sheep where some sheep may be missing from their place. We need a function that counts the number of sheep present in the array (true means present).

// For example,

// [true,  true,  true,  false,
//   true,  true,  true,  true ,
//   true,  false, true,  false,
//   true,  false, false, true ,
//   true,  true,  true,  true ,
//   false, false, true,  true]

// The correct answer would be 17.

// Hint: Don't forget to check for bad values like null/undefined

function countSheeps(arrayOfSheep) {
    // TODO May the force be with you
    let count = 0
    arrayOfSheep.forEach( e => {
      if(e == true){
        count++
      }
    })
    return count
  }

//   other solutions:

function countSheeps(arrayOfSheeps) {
    return arrayOfSheeps.filter(Boolean).length;
}

// Vowel Count

// Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.

// We will consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels for this Kata (but not y).

// The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.

function getCount(str) {
  
    let count = 0
    for(let i = 0; i < str.length; i++){
      if( (str[i] == 'a') || (str[i] == 'e') || (str[i] == 'i') || (str[i] == 'o') || (str[i] == 'u') ){
         count++
         }
    }
    
    return count
    
  }

  // other solutions:
  function getCount(str) {
    return str.split('').filter(c => "aeiouAEIOU".includes(c)).length;
   }

// Filter out the geese

// Write a function that takes a list of strings as an argument and returns a filtered list containing the same elements but with the 'geese' removed.

// The geese are any strings in the following array, which is pre-populated in your solution:

//   ["African", "Roman Tufted", "Toulouse", "Pilgrim", "Steinbacher"]
// For example, if this array were passed as an argument:

//  ["Mallard", "Hook Bill", "African", "Crested", "Pilgrim", "Toulouse", "Blue Swedish"]
// Your function would return the following array:

// ["Mallard", "Hook Bill", "Crested", "Blue Swedish"]
// The elements in the returned array should be in the same order as in the initial array passed to your function, albeit with the 'geese' removed. Note that all of the strings will be in the same case as those provided, and some elements may be repeated.

function gooseFilter (birds){
  var geese = ["African", "Roman Tufted", "Toulouse", "Pilgrim", "Steinbacher"];
  return birds.filter( bird => !geese.includes(bird))
}

// Reduce but grow
// Given a non-empty array of integers, return the result of multiplying the values together in order. Example:

// [1, 2, 3, 4] => 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24


function grow(x){
  let product = 1
  for( let i = 0; i<x.length; i++){
    product *= x[i]
  }
  return product
}

// using the reduce method

function grow(x){
  return  x.reduce((a,b) => a*b, 1);
}

// create a function to round the average of an array down to the nearest integer

function getAverage(marks){
  return Math.floor(marks.reduce((sum, x) => sum + x) / marks.length);
}

// total amount of points
// Our football team has finished the championship.

// Our team's match results are recorded in a collection of strings. Each match is represented by a string in the format "x:y", where x is our team's score and y is our opponents score.

// For example: ["3:1", "2:2", "0:1", ...]

// Points are awarded for each match as follows:

// if x > y: 3 points (win)
// if x < y: 0 points (loss)
// if x = y: 1 point (tie)
// We need to write a function that takes this collection and returns the number of points our team (x) got in the championship by the rules given above.

// Notes:

// our team always plays 10 matches in the championship
// 0 <= x <= 4
// 0 <= y <= 4

function points(games) {
  let points = 0
  let newArr = []
  games.forEach( game =>{
    newArr = game.split(':')
  if(newArr[0] > newArr[1]){
    points += 3
  }else if(newArr[0] == newArr[1]){
    points +=1
  } })
  return points
}

// other solutions: 
function points(games){
  return games.reduce((output, current) => {
    return output += current[0]>current[2] ? 3 : current[0] === current[2] ? 1 : 0
  }, 0  )
}

//highest profit 

// Story
// Ben has a very simple idea to make some profit: he buys something and sells it again. Of course, this wouldn't give him any profit at all if he was simply to buy and sell it at the same price. Instead, he's going to buy it for the lowest possible price and sell it at the highest.

// Task
// Write a function that returns both the minimum and maximum number of the given list/array.

// Examples (Input --> Output)
// [1,2,3,4,5] --> [1,5]
// [2334454,5] --> [5,2334454]
// [1]         --> [1,1]
// Remarks
// All arrays or lists will always have at least one element, so you don't need to check the length. Also, your function will always get an array or a list, you don't have to check for null

function minMax(arr){
  return [Math.min(...arr), Math.max(...arr)]; // fix me!
}
