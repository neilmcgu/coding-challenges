Code Wars

Some people like to solve Sudokus, some people like to work on Cross Word Puzzles... I like to solve coding challenges. At the beginning of each day I take some time to work through a few code wars challenges to keep my mind sharp.

Challenges 

I really love when Code Wars gives me a difficult challenge and I have to wrack my brain to figure it out. The simple challenges are great for reminding myself how to do basic tasks. So far the hardest challenge I had to complete required recursion which felt great when I finally figured it out.

Lessons Learned:

There are many ways to solve the same problems, some of which are more clear than others. I pride myself on completing challenges in as few lines as possible while also maintaining clean, readable code. Sometimes a single line function just doesn't make sense at a glance. I try to avoid confusing anyone who reads my code even if it means a couple of extra lines.
